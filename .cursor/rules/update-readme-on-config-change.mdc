# README Update Rule

Whenever you introduce a new configurable option (such as an environment variable, CLI flag, or config file setting) or change the behavior of an existing one, you must update the [README.md](mdc:README.md) to document the new or changed option. This ensures users are always aware of all configuration options and their effects.
