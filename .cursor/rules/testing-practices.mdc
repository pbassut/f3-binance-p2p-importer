# Testing Practices Rule

Every time code is changed in this project, you must:

1. Add or adjust test cases in the relevant test files to cover the new or modified code.
2. Run the test suite (using the configured test runner, e.g., Vitest) after making changes.
3. If any tests fail, continue modifying the code and/or the tests until all tests pass.

This ensures that the codebase remains reliable and that all changes are properly tested.
