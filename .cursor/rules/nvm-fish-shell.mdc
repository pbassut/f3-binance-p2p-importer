# Fish Shell Environment Rule

This project is developed using the fish shell, not bash. Any instructions or scripts for setting up environment variables, nvm, or similar tools must use fish-compatible syntax. For example, to load nvm in fish, use:

```
set -x NVM_DIR $HOME/.nvm
source $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh
```

Avoid bash-specific commands in documentation or automation.
